SNHU CS465 Fullstack development 

## EXPRESS / HTML/ JS vs SPA
- Express HTML is a server-side templating language that allows us to generate dynamic HTML pages based on data retrieved from the backend.
It is used to render views that are then sent to the client as a complete HTML document. On the other hand, JavaScript is a client-side programming language that runs on the user's browser and is used to add interactivity to the frontend. 
It is used to manipulate the DOM, make AJAX requests, and perform other client-side operations.
- (SPA) is a frontend development approach that uses a single HTML page to create an application that feels more like a native desktop or
mobile application. Rather than reloading the entire page for each action,  
SPAs dynamically update parts of the page, providing a smoother and more responsive user experience.

## NoSQL MongoDB
- The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it is a highly scalable and flexible database system that can handle a wide range of data types and structures.
-Used for the different room and travel packages.

## JSON VS JS
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is used to transmit data between the frontend and backend.
-JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic web pages.

## Refactoring code:
- Refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiencies is an important part of the full stack development process. 
- We can use gitlab or github to optimize collaboration of code refefactoring
- One instance where refactoring was used in our project was when we created reusable UI components. By creating reusable components, we were able to reduce duplication in our code, 
improve maintainability, and reduce the amount of code we needed to write. 

## Methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
- Methods refer to the different types of HTTP methods used to make requests to the backend, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
- Endpoints are the URLs that are used to access different parts of the API, such as /users or /trips.
-  Security is an important consideration in full stack applications, as there are many potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
- We can use SSL/TLS encryption , Authetication and Authorization, Input Validation/Senitatation, , MFA, Hashing in full stack development.
